## A Little More on the Tech Lab
Web APIs are powerful tools that provide users a way to query data using the internet. Data is often returned to users in the flexible JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) format, leading to web APIs and JSON often being taught hand-in-hand. Web APIs have all sorts of uses, from healthcare data from international governments, to showing the New York Times' most recent Best Sellers list, to getting a random photo of a beagle puppy. 

This Tech Lab includes a brief introduction to web APIs and JSON in its accompanying PowerPoint, explaining the how and why of web APIs. The Jupyter Notebook provides users a way  to apply what they've learned in the PowerPoint and get started with working with web APIs using Python. This Tech Lab is intended for those with no knowledge of JSON or web APIS, but it is helpful to have an introductory understanding of Python in order to understand the implemention portion of the lab.
